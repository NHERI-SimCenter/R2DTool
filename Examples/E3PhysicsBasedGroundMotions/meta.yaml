summary: |
  This example features ground motion acceleration time histories simulated using the SW4 software and a detailed geophysical model of the San Francisco Bay Area by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [doi: 10.1785/0220180261]. The ground motions are used to investigate the impact of a Mw7.0 earthquake on the Hayward fault on the city of Berkeley. Engineering Demand Parameters are simulated with an idealized MDOF building model; building performance is evaluated at the story-level based on the HAZUS earthquake damage and loss assessment methodology.
