This open-source research application provides an application
researchers can use to predict regional damage and loss estimates
for a region subjected to a natural hazard.

The computations are performed in a workflow application. That is, the
numerical simulations are actually performed by a number of different
applications. The rWHALE backend software runs these different
applications for the user, taking the outputs from some programs and
providing them as inputs to others. The design of the R2D
application is such that researchers are able to modify the backend
applications to utilize their own application in the workflow
computations. This will ensure researchers are not limited to using
the default applications we provide and will be enthused to provide
their own applications for others to use.

This application is under active development. Researchers are encouraged to comment on what additional
features and applications they would like to see in this
application. If you want it, chances are many of your colleagues also
would benefit from it.
